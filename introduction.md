## Introduction
Wikipedia the largest reference work ever created, an online encylopedia where articles are written collaboratively by users and anyone can contribute. Authors can add links to other pages on Wikipedia creating ways of navigating this network of information. This has been turned into a game, Wikispeedia. The game is simple, navigate from one article to another as quickly as possible. How to do this effectivly? Hubs are articles on Wikipedia that are linked to many other articles in the Wikipedia network. This makes them access points to get from one piece of information to another. By using data over navigation paths in the Wikispeedia game, we identify which articles are hubs on Wikipedia, explore how well users navigate to hubs and .... common knowledge.

## Hubs
What hubs are on Wikipedia? To answer this question let's have a look at some data. In the Wikipedia version of wikispeedia there are 4604 articles. Figure X shows a histogram of the number of links from Wikipedia pages. 

From this data we can see that there is an uneaven distribution of the number of links of articles which is not suprising. Median value is 19 links, minimum 0 and max 294.

Hubs not only have to have many links to or from one article to others. They must also be well connected in the network to be able to navigate from one piece of information to another. How interconnected is the Wikipedia network? Data over the shortest path from one article to another. If it is possible to navigate from one article to another the maximum distance is only 9 clicks away. That means from any article to any other which it is possible to navigate to 9 is the maximum number of clicks you might have to take. Figure X shows a histogram over mean shortest path from articles to any other articles for which it is possible to navigate to. For this articles which are not connected to more than X other article will filtered out since their mean value is miss leading. The median value, max min.. 

What articles have the most outgoing links and are the most interconnected articles and the articles with the most outgoing links.

Defining hubs... Using page rank, gives a continuous measure of hubness.

### Navigation Efficiency
Users often rely on hubs to navigate between articles. Measuring how efficiently these hubs are used can provide insights into user behavior and knowledge patterns.
