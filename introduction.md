## Introduction
Wikipedia contains vast information about the world and the articles on Wikipedia are written in a collaborative manner. Authors can add links to other pages on wikipedia creating ways of navigating this network of information. Hubs are articles on Wikipedia that are linked to many other articles in the Wikipedia network. This makes them access points to get from one piece of information to another. By using data over navigation paths in the Wikispeedia game, we explore how well users navigate hubs and what it says about our common knowledge.

## Hubs
What hubs are on Wikipedia? First, some initial analysis to identify the hubs in the Wikipedia network. This was done by looking at the number of links to and from wikipedia pages.

The longest distance from one article to another which it is possible to navigate to is 9 clicks. By looking at the mean shortest path we can get a understanding of how closely linked articles are to the rest of the articles in the wikipedia network.

### Identifying Hubs in Wikispeedia
Key hubs are defined as articles with a high number of incoming and outgoing links. These hubs play an essential role in connecting various topics within the Wikipedia ecosystem.

### Navigation Efficiency
Users often rely on hubs to navigate between articles. Measuring how efficiently these hubs are used can provide insights into user behavior and knowledge patterns.
